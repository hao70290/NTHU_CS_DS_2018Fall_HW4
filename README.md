# NTHU_CS_DS_2018Fall_HW4
Implement basic graph data structure and functions

## implementation
•addEdge  
•shortest path  
•minimum spanning tree  
•two color    

## Input
Input starts with an integer n indicating the number of nodes in the graph, 0 <= n<= 2500.  
Then, a set of m edges, 0<= m<=950000, and k command, 0<=0k<=30, are given.  
The following four commands might appear multiple times (even interleaving) add, shortest_path, mst_weight, two_colorable.  

## Output
Print the outputs of the given commands.

## Keywaords
